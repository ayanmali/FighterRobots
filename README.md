# FighterRobots
Virtual robots fight against each other in a battlefield, and the last robot standing wins. Made with the Becker library in Java.
NOTE: Some files were not created by me. The FighterRobot and OppData classes as well as the TurnRequest and PlayerStats files were created by someone else.
The other files were created by me and inherit from one of the classes mentioned above.
This project was an opportunity for me to demonstrate my skills in object oriented programming, as well as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and other programming concepts.
